what is ES6?
ES6, or ECMAScript 6, is a major update to the JavaScript language specification that was finalized in June 2015. It brought significant enhancements and new features to JavaScript, making the language more powerful, expressive, and easier to work with.

Some key features introduced in ES6 include:

Arrow Functions: A concise way to write functions.
Let and Const: Block-scoped variable declarations with let and constants with const.
Template Literals: A convenient way to create strings using backticks.
Enhanced Object Literals: Shorthand syntax for defining object properties and methods.
Destructuring Assignment: Extracting values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.
Classes: Syntactical sugar over prototype-based inheritance for creating objects.
Default Parameters: Setting default values for function parameters.
Rest and Spread Operators: ... syntax for handling variable numbers of arguments.
Promises: Built-in support for handling asynchronous operations more easily.
Modules: A standardized way to organize and reuse JavaScript code.
